## Building for scale

- Modularize the app by creating independent component libraries that can be managed and scoped to specific projects. This will make it easier to maintain and update your app, and it will also make it more reusable across projects. Using some like NX makes this really easy.
- If there is a large component library, consider using a storybook project (or similar) to document and visualize all components. This is a great way to collaborate with UX/digital designers too, and it will also make it easier for developers to find and use the components they need.
- For large data sets optimize data fetching by loading products on demand and caching results. This will improve the performance of your app and reduce the load time.

If I had more time I would...

- Improve the test coverage across the application
- Modularize the application further into smaller, independent components. - for example, the button icons, navigation, nav links ..
- clean up the UI
